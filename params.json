  "body": "## Setting up Remote Powershell Execution from Jenkins\r\n\r\nNeed to setup a way to deploy applications from our build server, out to the production servers.  We want these deployments to be manually invoked.  To set this up via powershell we need to do a few things.\r\n\r\n1. Enable PS Remoting on both the server (build machine) and the client (production machine)\r\n2. Enable Script Exection\r\n\r\n### Set up the Build Machine\r\n\r\nPowershell is weird and you can't remote to anything without some setup first.  We have to enable Powershell Remoting, and then basically tell powershell that everything is a trusted connection.\r\n\r\nFirst enable script execution\r\n\r\n```ps\r\nSet-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted -Force\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext enable PS-Remoting\r\n\r\n```ps\r\nEnable-PSRemoting -Force\r\nwinrm s winrm/config/client '@{TrustedHosts=\"*\"}'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Set up the Deploy Server\r\n\r\n1. Open port 5985\r\n2. Run the following Powershell command\r\n    ```ps\r\n    Enable-PSRemoting -Force\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Test out the settings\r\n\r\nTo test the settings, we should attempt to connect to the remote machine and run some commands\r\n```ps\r\n$password = convertto-securestring -asplaintext -force -string \"my password\"\r\n$credential = new-object -typename system.management.automation.pscredential -argumentlist \"MY_USERNAME\", $password \r\n$session = new-pssession MY_EC2_PUBLIC_IP -credential $credential \r\nEnter-PSSession $session  \r\nWrite-Host \"Hello, World (from $env:COMPUTERNAME)\"\r\n```",
